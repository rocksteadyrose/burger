Eat-Da-Burger! is a burger logger/restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. It was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. Node and MySql were used to query and route data, and Handlebars was utilized to generate HTML.

HOW TO USE:
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page
* The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not
